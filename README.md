## Project Description
This application is made for  users who want to get a dog but are, maybe, uncertain which dog breed is best for lifestyle.

Fido For You allows the user to take a 3 questions quiz, with each question containing 3 choices. The purpose of the quiz is to allow the user to idicate the size, temperment and breed group he would like the dog to possess. 

Once the quiz questions have been aswered, the user sees images of the suggested breed/breeds that best meet the criteria for what was indicated in the quiz.

We want to give the user a great head start in preparation for a new fur family member therefor we are ready to suggest 'dog care books' pertaining to the breed image the user selects.
